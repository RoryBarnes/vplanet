VPLanet Examples
================

This subdirectory contains examples of numerous ways to use `VPLanet`. A brief
description of each is provided below, arranged by topic [with modules listed in brackets]. Click on the directory to see VPLanet input files, Python scripts,
plots, and more description of the physics. Use these VPLanet input files and Python scripts to reproduce published figures, or as a starting point to begin your own fundamental research. The simulations used to generate these figures are `validated with continuous integration <../tests>`_ with the identical (or representative, in the case of parameter sweeps) initial conditions. Looking for something not present? E-mail Rory Barnes, rory@astro.washington.edu, to inquire if that functionality is available and validated.

It is optional to install vplot and you can run VPLanet with installing vplot. However, to run the Python scripts and generate the figures in the subdirectories, you must install `vplot <https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/vplot>`_.
